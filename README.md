# Snake Game by dwikadio
This project is a simple implementation of the Snake game using Python and the Pygame module. In this game, the player controls a snake that tries to eat food randomly appearing on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, its length increases and the player earns points.

## Key Features:
A controllable snake using arrow keys on the keyboard.
Food randomly appearing on the screen after being eaten by the snake.
The game ends when the snake hits the screen's boundary or itself.
Sound effects enhancing the gaming experience.

## Installation and Usage:
Make sure Python and the Pygame module are installed on your computer.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the game by executing the snake_game.py file.

## Notes:
Make sure to enable sound while playing the game as it adds to the immersive experience.
You can adjust the snake's speed and the number of obstacles through the snake_speed and num_obstacles variables in the code.
This project is created by dwikadio and inspired by online tutorials and other Python and Pygame resources.
